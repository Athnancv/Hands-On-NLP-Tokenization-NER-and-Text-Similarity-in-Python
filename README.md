# 📝 Text Mining & Natural Language Processing (NLP)

A hands-on project demonstrating core concepts of **Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using Python. This notebook showcases how raw text is processed and transformed into meaningful information through preprocessing, linguistic analysis, and similarity measurement.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Provide a beginner-friendly, end-to-end walkthrough of essential NLP techniques, showing how unstructured text can be converted into structured data for tasks such as text similarity, classification, and information retrieval.

---

## 📊 Dataset / Input

This project uses sample texts and toy examples for demonstration:

📖 A paragraph about NLP for preprocessing tasks  
📝 Two example sentences for similarity testing  
- “I killed Ram and Rakesh”  
- “I brought chicken and mutton”  

Outputs are displayed to clearly illustrate NLP transformations and comparisons.

## 🧪 Approach

### 🔹 Text Preprocessing
- Sentence & word tokenization  
- Stopword removal  
- Lowercasing and text normalization  
- Stemming (Porter Stemmer)  
- Lemmatization (WordNet Lemmatizer)

### 🔹 Linguistic Analysis
- POS (Part-of-Speech) Tagging  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

### 🔹 Feature Engineering & Similarity
- Bag-of-Words representation  
- Cosine similarity for document comparison

---

## 📈 Results

✔ Clean and structured text after preprocessing  
✔ Accurate identification of grammatical roles via POS tagging  
✔ Detection of named entities (e.g., person names)  
✔ Cosine similarity highlights differences between documents

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

🧹 Text preprocessing significantly improves analysis quality  
🧠 POS tagging and NER enhance syntactic & semantic understanding  
⚡ Bag-of-Words + Cosine Similarity provides a strong baseline  
🚀 Serves as a foundation for advanced NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and classification
